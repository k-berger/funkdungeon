# What Is This?
This repo is a time-travel experience, to say the least :-) 
When I was a kid, I was the proud (!) owner of an AMIGA. Well, actually multiple AMIGAs as this little machine was what I used from 1988 to 1993 and I switched from A500 to A1200 at some point.
The AMIGA is where I learned (or rather got in touch with) programming initially - which is now my job for more than 2 decades.
A language that was pretty accessible and could produce interesting results - and was actually used for a couple commercial products, too - was BlitzBasic 2.
*Funkdungeon / Vania* is my way of getting back to my roots and see what I can do with AmiBlitz (the successor of BlitzBasic) and an AMIGA emulator.

# Yeah sure, but why?
I love it. I loved AMIGAs more than any other computer I ever owned - not only because the operating-system was soooo much ahead of anything else at that time, but also because the people writing software (games, demos, applications) where capabable of squeezing a lot out of these machines, despite their physical restrictions. (You can read up on those anyway, so I won't put them here. Who cares anyway?)
So I want to find out whether I (and a friend of mine) can write an actual game for the AMIGA.
The resource constraints that I will face there are far different from anything I face at work and it will probably train my optimization muscle enough to also flex it at work.

# About Funk-Dungeon / Vania
In our thoughts this game is going to be some kind of a rogue-like dungeon-crawler, but we might pivot eventually and do something entirely different.
Nothing but the thought of being able to slap a tag on a not-yet-existing game like that tells me that the idea is probably bad.
Back in the days (oh yeah, that's long ago) games had to be original - which is something that is rare to find today, especially with AAA games on PC or consoles. Niche, indie games exist of course and - if I play anything - that's what I play. But if you can get around building an original game around a good idea instead of spending gazillions of dollars on "producing" it to be AAA and be roasted on Steam, why not try it?
By no means will this game ever have any players except some nostalgic AMIGA nerds. And that's cool.
If you stumble over this repo by coincidence or curiosity, drop me a message if you have ideas.
I can't promise to build it. I can't even promise to finish it, as I really just want to try doing something "as in the olden days" ;-P
